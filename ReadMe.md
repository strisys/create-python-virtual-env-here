# 'Create Python Virtual Environment Here' PowerShell Script

[This is a simple PowerShell script](./create-venv-project-here.ps1) to create a [Python virtual environment project](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html).  Python version 3.3 or above is required.  The steps to use this file are as follows:

1. Create a project folder.

2. Copy [`create-venv-project-here.ps1`](./create-venv-project-here.ps1) to that folder

3. Run [`create-venv-project-here.ps1`](./create-venv-project-here.ps1)

4. Delete  [`create-venv-project-here.ps1`](./create-venv-project-here.ps1)

This will create a Python virtual environment along with a `main.py` and `requirements.txt` file.  The virtual environment may also be activated but sometimes VS Code has to be restared.
