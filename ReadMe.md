# 'Create Python Virtual Environment Here' PowerShell Script

A PowerShell script to create a Python virtual environment project.  The steps are as follows:

1. Create a project folder.

2. Copy [PowerShell file called `create-venv-project-here.ps1`](./create-venv-project-here.ps1) to that directory

3. Run [`create-venv-project-here.ps1`](./create-venv-project-here.ps1)

4. Delete  [`create-venv-project-here.ps1`](./create-venv-project-here.ps1)

This will create a Python virtual environment along with a `main.py` and `requirements.txt` file.  The virtual environment will also be activated.
